#### Questionnaire

I'll send over a **questionnaire** with important questions to help me prepare. After you complete the questionnaire, we'll **schedule our first meeting** to talk about your project in-depth.

Yes, it's **lengthy**—but that's intentional. Many clients find the process itself valuable, and you'll walk away with a copy you can reference at any time, share with stakeholders, or use as a foundation for other projects.

#### First meeting &amp; initial proposal

By the time we meet, I'll already have a solid understanding of your project from your answers from the questionnaire. This means our conversation can be **much more productive**—we can dive deeper into the important stuff rather than spending hours covering the basics.

During our first meeting, we'll discuss your project in depth. After this conversation, I'll create and **send over an initial proposal**.

#### Proposal adjustments

During our follow-up call, we'll **review the proposal** together. You can review it at your convenience beforehand, text me questions, and we'll make sure we're aligned.

We'll **adjust the proposal** as needed based on your feedback, and I'll **send over the adjusted version**. Once you're ready, we'll get your approval to move forward.

&rarr; _Usually the proposal gets tweaked a bit during this stage._

#### Onboarding &amp; setup

Once you accept the proposal, we'll meet on Zoom or Google Meet to confirm details, make any final tweaks if needed, and plan next steps.

I'll **create a Google Doc for you** that serves as your _"home base."_ I'll **copy the proposal into this document** so everything is in one place.

The Google Doc will include:

- A simple checklist of what I need from you before the kickoff call (deliverables)
- Notes, decisions, and anything important for your project
- A place for you to share assets with me via Google Drive

If you'd like a contract, I'll prepare and send that over as well.

_&nbsp;💰&nbsp;At this point you will make your **first** of three payments (your deposit)._

#### Initial Research

Once I _receive your initial payment_, I start to dig in:

I'll **research your competitors/peers** and identify patterns in your market.

##### Style &amp; Moodboard

If you are doing any new design—I'll create a mood board (often using Pinterest) with visuals that set the tone for your site—colors, typography, imagery, and design inspiration.

I'll create a simple **StyleScape**: a single image showing the visual direction (colors, fonts, photography, and overall layout feel).

You'll review it and tell me what does or doesn't fit the vision.

##### Sitemap

I'll create a clear sitemap showing the structure of the site (_yes, even for one-pagers_) and the pages we're building.

I'll send this over to you **you'll have 24 hours to send any question or revisions you have**.

##### Timeline

I'll develop a rough timeline based on how long I think everything will take.

##### Deliverables

I'll identify any additional deliverables I will need to complete the project and _update the Google Doc_.

**You'll need to get _all deliverables_ over to me before we continue.**

<hr>

#### Kickoff

Once all deliverables are in—and the stylescape/sitemap are approved—we'll schedule a **kickoff call.**

We'll confirm direction and make sure everything is aligned and plan to begin the actual build.

During this step we'll also finalize a timeline for:

- When Design & Development begins and ends
- When Testing and Pre-launch begins and ends
- When Launch will happen

_&nbsp;💰&nbsp;At this point you will make your **second** of three payments._

#### Design & Development

I typically design the homepage **first**.

When it's ready, I'll share it with you over a screen share.

You'll see:

- The visual direction
- The reasoning behind key design decisions
- Key performance considerations

You'll get one round of feedback on the homepage at this stage due within 24 hours.

##### Finalize, Build, & Review

After updating the homepage based on your feedback (and confirming the sitemap), I'll design the rest of the core pages.

I'll screen share the updated homepage and the new subpages for review.

You'll get one final round of feedback on the remaining core pages before we proceed to the final build and polish.

#### Testing & Launch

During this phase we'll get the site up on a server and start connecting everything needed to make it work (forms, integrations, payment gateways if applicable, analytics, etc.).

I'll also begin writing your website documentation.

Together, we test everything: layout, content, links, forms, and performance. _At this point we won't be changing anything drastically—just making sure everything works correctly and looks great._

After the site is fully polished, we'll choose a day to go live.

_&nbsp;💰&nbsp;At this point you will make your **third** and final payment._

<hr>

#### Post-Launch Support

For one week after launch, I'm available for questions and support as you settle into the new site.

#### Offboarding Call & What's Next

After the support week, we'll have an offboarding call to review how everything went.

We'll talk through the launch, answer any final questions, and discuss next steps if you'd like to continue working together.

#### Maintenance

If we agree to ongoing maintenance, your maintenance plan will begin after launch. Your site will be set up to auto-update where possible, and if anything goes wrong or issues creep up, we can address them quickly.

_&nbsp;💰&nbsp;Note: maintenance is a monthly subscription fee._
