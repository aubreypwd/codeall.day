	<h3>1. Onboarding</h3>
	<p>You’ll receive an in-depth questionnaire. Your answers give me everything I need to understand your goals, your business, and the look and feel you want.</p>
	<p>We’ll also discuss deliverables (things I need from you), which all have to be delivered by the kick-off date—which we will choose together.</p>
	<p>🏢 At this point you will make your first of three payments.</p>

	<h3>2. Setup</h3>
	<p>You’ll get a single Google Doc that serves as your “home base,” like this one.</p>
	<p>It will include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A simple checklist of what I need from you before the kickoff call (Deliverables)</li>
		<li>Notes, decisions, and anything important for your project</li>
		<li>A place for you to share assets/etc with me (Google Drive)</li>
		<li><strong>Bookmark it!</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Everything stays in one place for you. No extra tools to learn, it’s easy.</p>

	<h3>3. Research &amp; Exploration</h3>
	<p>Once I have your questionnaire and initial payment, I dig in:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Review your answers (questionnaire)</li>
		<li>Look at your competitors/peers</li>
		<li>Identify design patterns used by successful businesses in your space</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I’ll add my findings to the Google Doc so you can see the direction things are heading.</p>

	<h5>3a. Mood Board</h5>
	<p>I’ll create a mood board (usually with Pinterest) with visuals that set the tone for your site—colors, typography, imagery, design inspiration.</p>
	<p>You can review it any time and tell me what does or doesn’t fit your vision.</p>

	<h5>3b. Stylescape</h5>
	<p>I’ll create a simple stylescape: a single image showing the visual direction (colors, fonts, photography, layout feel).</p>
	<p>You’ll review it and confirm we’re aligned before we move forward.</p>

	<h5>3c. Site Map</h5>
	<p>I’ll create a clear site map showing the structure of the site and the pages we’re building. You’ll approve this before design begins.</p>

	<h5>4c. Timeline</h5>
	<p>Based on the work that needs to be done I will develop a timeline on our kickoff call.</p>

	<h3>4. Kickoff Call</h3>
	<p>Once all deliverables are in and the stylescape/site map are approved, we’ll schedule a kickoff call.</p>
	<p>We’ll confirm direction, make sure everything is aligned, the timeline is good, and then we begin the actual build.</p>
	<p>During this step we will create a timeline:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>When Design &amp; Development begins and ends</li>
		<li>When Testing and Pre-launch will begin and end</li>
		<li>When Launch will happen</li>
	</ul>
	<p>🏢 At this point you will make your second of three payments.</p>

	<h3>5. Design &amp; Development</h3>
	<p>I’ll usually design the homepage <strong>first</strong>.</p>
	<p>When it’s ready, I’ll share it with you over a screen share.</p>
	<p>You’ll see:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The visual direction</li>
		<li>The decisions behind the design</li>
		<li>Key performance considerations</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You get one free round of feedback on the homepage and sitemap at this stage.</p>

	<h5>5b. Finalize, Build, &amp; Review</h5>
	<p>After updating the homepage based on your feedback (and sitemap), I’ll design the rest of the core pages.</p>
	<p><strong>This is the longest part of the process.</strong></p>
	<p>I’ll screen share the updated homepage and the new subpages for review.</p>
	<p>You’ll get one final round of feedback on both before we proceed to build the remaining parts of the site.</p>

	<h3>6. Testing &amp; Launch</h3>
	<p>During this phase we’ll get the site up on a server and start connecting your website with all-the-things to make sure it works, e.g. payment gateways, etc.</p>
	<p>I will also begin writing your website documentation (which lives <em>inside</em> your website for easy access).</p>
	<p>Together, we test everything: layout, content, links, forms, and performance. <em>At this point we won’t be changing anything drastically, just making sure it works correctly.</em></p>
	<p>After the site is fully polished, we’ll choose a launch date and go live on that date (it’s usually just a button I push and it’s live).</p>
	<p>🏢 At this point you will make your third and final payment.</p>

	<h3>7. Post-Launch Support</h3>
	<p>For a week after launch, I’m available for questions and support as you settle into the new site.</p>

	<h3>8. Offboarding Call &amp; What’s Next</h3>
	<p>After the support week, we’ll have an offboarding call to review how everything went.</p>
	<p>We’ll talk about the results, answer any final questions, and discuss any next steps if you want to continue working together.</p>

	<h3>9. Maintenance</h3>
	<p>If we agreed to do so, our maintenance agreement will begin to kick in. Your site will be designed to auto-update all-the-things moving forward, but if anything goes wrong or issues creep up we can address them quickly.</p>
	<p>🏢 Note, this is going to be a monthly subscription fee.</p>
