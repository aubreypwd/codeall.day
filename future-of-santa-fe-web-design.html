Most Santa Fe web design agencies still build the same way they did ten years ago. WordPress themes, heavy plugins, and slow load times are common, even as Google shifts toward AI-powered search and stricter performance standards.

In a city shaped by the state capital, world-renowned art galleries, government contractors, luxury tourism, and a thriving creative economy, that old approach is starting to fail.
